This is a github repository for the scripts used in the following study:

Dermawan JK...Vanderbilt CM, Antonescu CR. Chromoplexy is a frequent early clonal event in EWSR1-rearranged round cell sarcomas that can be detected using clinically validated NGS platforms. 2023.

Summary:
This study detects chromoplexy in a substantial portion of Ewing sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumors as an early and persistent clonal event using targeted next-generation sequencing (MSK-IMPACT). A validation cohort in a set of matched tumor-normal WES data was also included in the study.
